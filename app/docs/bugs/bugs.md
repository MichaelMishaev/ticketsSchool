## =4 CRITICAL BUGS

### Bug #1: Account Takeover via OAuth Auto-Linking
**File:** `/app/api/auth/google/callback/route.ts` (lines 84-92)
**Severity:** =4 CRITICAL

**Description:**
When a user authenticates via Google OAuth, the system automatically links their Google account to any existing account with the same email address, without requiring password verification. This allows an attacker to take over accounts.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Victim has account: `victim@example.com` (password: `MySecurePass123`)
2. Attacker creates Google account: `victim@example.com`
3. Attacker clicks "Sign in with Google" on our app
4. System auto-links attacker's Google account to victim's account
5. Attacker now has full access to victim's account without knowing the password

**Current Code:**
```typescript
let admin = await prisma.admin.findFirst({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { googleId },
      { email },  // � DANGEROUS: No password check
    ],
  },
})
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Safe approach: Only link if password is not set (OAuth-only account)
let admin = await prisma.admin.findUnique({
  where: { googleId }
})

if (!admin) {
  const existingByEmail = await prisma.admin.findUnique({
    where: { email }
  })

  if (existingByEmail && existingByEmail.passwordHash) {
    // Require password confirmation before linking
    return NextResponse.redirect(
      new URL('/admin/link-google?email=' + encodeURIComponent(email), BASE_URL)
    )
  }

  // Only auto-link if no password is set (OAuth-only account)
  admin = existingByEmail || await prisma.admin.create({
    data: {
      email,
      name,
      googleId,
      emailVerified: true,
      passwordHash: null,
      role: 'OWNER',
      onboardingCompleted: false,
      lastLoginAt: new Date(),
    },
  })
}
```

**Status:** =4 OPEN

### Bug #2: Session Tampering via Unsigned Cookies
**File:** `/lib/auth.server.ts` (lines 20-30)
**Severity:** =4 CRITICAL

**Description:**
User sessions are stored in cookies as base64-encoded JSON without signing or encryption. This allows attackers to decode, modify, and re-encode sessions to escalate privileges or impersonate other users.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker logs in as normal user
2. Gets session cookie: `eyJhZG1pbklkIjoiY2x4eXo...` (base64)
3. Decodes: `{"adminId":"clxyz123","email":"attacker@evil.com","role":"SCHOOL_ADMIN",...}`
4. Changes role to `SUPER_ADMIN`
5. Re-encodes and replaces cookie
6. Now has super admin access

**Current Code:**
```typescript
function encodeSession(session: AuthSession): string {
  return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(session)).toString('base64')
}

function decodeSession(token: string): AuthSession | null {
  try {
    const decoded = Buffer.from(token, 'base64').toString('utf8')
    return JSON.parse(decoded) as AuthSession
  } catch {
    return null
  }
}
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
import * as jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'

const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET
if (!JWT_SECRET) {
  throw new Error('JWT_SECRET environment variable is required')
}

function encodeSession(session: AuthSession): string {
  return jwt.sign(session, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '7d' })
}

function decodeSession(token: string): AuthSession | null {
  try {
    return jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET) as AuthSession
  } catch {
    return null
  }
}
```

**Status:** =4 OPEN

---

### Bug #3: No Server-Side Route Protection
**File:** Missing `/middleware.ts`
**Severity:** =4 CRITICAL

**Description:**
Admin routes are only protected client-side via React useEffect. Attackers can bypass this by directly calling admin API endpoints.

**Attack Scenario:**
```bash
# No authentication required for these:
curl http://localhost:9000/api/events
curl http://localhost:9000/api/dashboard/stats
curl http://localhost:9000/api/admin/feedback
```

**Fix:**
Create `/middleware.ts` in project root:
```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const path = request.nextUrl.pathname

  // Public paths
  const isPublicPath =
    path.startsWith('/api/auth') ||
    path.startsWith('/api/admin/signup') ||
    path.startsWith('/api/admin/login') ||
    path.startsWith('/api/admin/verify-email') ||
    path.startsWith('/api/admin/forgot-password') ||
    path.startsWith('/api/admin/reset-password') ||
    path.startsWith('/p/') ||
    path === '/admin/login' ||
    path === '/admin/signup' ||
    path === '/admin/forgot-password' ||
    path === '/admin/reset-password'

  if (isPublicPath) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }

  // Check for admin session cookie
  const sessionCookie = request.cookies.get('admin_session')

  if (!sessionCookie) {
    if (path.startsWith('/api/')) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
    }
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/admin/login', request.url))
  }

  // TODO: Verify JWT signature here after fixing Bug #2

  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/admin/:path*', '/api/:path*']
}
```

**Status:** =4 OPEN

---

### Bug #4: Weak JWT Secret Fallback
**File:** `/app/api/admin/signup/route.ts` (line 7)
**Severity:** =4 CRITICAL (if deployed without JWT_SECRET)

**Description:**
If `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is not set, a hardcoded fallback secret is used for email verification tokens.

**Current Code:**
```typescript
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'fallback-secret-for-dev'
```

**Attack Scenario:**
1. App deployed to production without setting `JWT_SECRET`
2. Attacker knows fallback secret (from public GitHub repo)
3. Attacker generates verification tokens for any email
4. Takes over any account by "verifying" their email

**Fix:**
```typescript
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET
if (!JWT_SECRET) {
  throw new Error('JWT_SECRET environment variable is required')
}
```

**Status:** =4 OPEN

## =� MODERATE BUGS

### Bug #5: Cookie Operations Not Awaited
**File:** `/app/api/auth/google/callback/route.ts` (lines 36, 45, 145)
**Severity:** =� MODERATE

**Description:**
In Next.js 15, the `cookies()` function returns a Promise, but cookie operations like `delete()` and `set()` may also return Promises. Not awaiting these could cause race conditions.

**Fix:**
Check Next.js 15 documentation and add `await` if necessary:
```typescript
await cookieStore.delete('oauth_state')
await cookieStore.set(SESSION_COOKIE_NAME, encodeSession(session), {...})
```

**Status:** =� OPEN

---

### Bug #6: Email Case Inconsistency
**File:** `/app/api/admin/signup/route.ts` (lines 51, 78)
**Severity:** =� MODERATE

**Description:**
Email is lowercased when checking for duplicates but not when creating the admin record. This could lead to database containing both `User@Example.com` and `user@example.com`.

**Current Code:**
```typescript
// Line 51 - Query with lowercase
const existingAdmin = await prisma.admin.findUnique({
  where: { email: email.toLowerCase() },
})

// Line 78 - Create with original case
email: email.toLowerCase(),  // This is correct but missing!
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Line 78
const admin = await prisma.admin.create({
  data: {
    email: email.toLowerCase(),  // Add this
    passwordHash,
    name,
    // ...
  },
})
```

**Status:** =� OPEN

---

### Bug #7: School Name Uniqueness May Cause UX Issues
**File:** `/app/api/admin/onboarding/route.ts` (lines 44-58)
**Severity:** =� MODERATE

**Description:**
School names must be globally unique (case-insensitive). This may cause issues for legitimate organizations with common names like "High School" or "Community Center".

**Error Message:**
```
"�� ������ ��� ��� ���� ������, ��� �� ���"
```

**Recommendation:**
Consider one of:
1. Remove school name uniqueness constraint (only enforce slug uniqueness)
2. Suggest alternative names with numbers ("High School 2")
3. Use namespace/region-based uniqueness

**Status:** =� OPEN - Needs product decision

---

### Bug #8: Email Send Failure Ignored During Signup
**File:** `/app/api/admin/signup/route.ts` (lines 92-102)
**Severity:** =� MODERATE

**Description:**
If email verification fails to send (Resend API down, invalid API key, etc.), the account is still created but user cannot verify their email. User is stuck in unverified state.

**Current Code:**
```typescript
const emailSent = await sendVerificationEmail(
  email.toLowerCase(),
  verificationToken,
  name
)

if (!emailSent) {
  console.warn('[Signup] Verification email failed to send, but account was created')
}
// Returns success anyway!
```

**Fix Options:**
1. **Fail signup if email can't be sent:**
```typescript
if (!emailSent) {
  await prisma.admin.delete({ where: { id: admin.id } })
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Failed to send verification email. Please try again.' },
    { status: 500 }
  )
}
```

2. **Add "Resend Verification Email" feature** (better UX)

**Status:** =� OPEN

## =� LOW PRIORITY / ENHANCEMENTS

### Enhancement #1: No Auto-Login After Email Verification
**File:** `/app/api/admin/verify-email/route.ts` (lines 82-85)
**Severity:** =� LOW (UX enhancement)

**Description:**
After verifying email, user must manually log in again. Could be improved by auto-creating session.

**Comment in Code:**
```typescript
// Note: We can't use the login() function directly here because
// it sets cookies and we're in an API route
// Instead, we'll return success and let the frontend handle login
```

**Recommendation:**
Implement one-time login token or auto-redirect to login with credentials pre-filled.

**Status:** =� ENHANCEMENT

---

### Enhancement #2: Missing Composite Unique Index
**File:** `/prisma/schema.prisma`
**Severity:** =� LOW (performance)

**Description:**
No composite unique index on `[email, schoolId]` to prevent duplicate school memberships (though business logic may allow this).

**Recommendation:**
```prisma
model Admin {
  // ...
  @@unique([email, schoolId])
}
```

**Status:** =� ENHANCEMENT

## FIXED BUGS

### Bug #9: Google OAuth Session Using Base64 Instead of JWT + Edge Runtime Compatibility + Cookie Persistence + Layout Redirect
**Files:** `/app/api/auth/google/callback/route.ts`, `/middleware.ts`, `/app/admin/layout.tsx`
**Severity:** =4 CRITICAL
**Fixed Date:** 2025-11-10

**Description:**
After successful Google OAuth authentication, users were redirected back to login page. Four related issues were discovered and fixed:

**Issue 1: Base64 vs JWT Tokens**
The Google OAuth callback was using a different `encodeSession()` function that created base64-encoded JSON strings instead of proper JWT tokens.

**Error Log:**
```
[Middleware] Invalid session token: JsonWebTokenError: jwt malformed
    at middleware (middleware.ts:70:21)
```

**Issue 2: Edge Runtime Incompatibility**
After fixing Issue 1, middleware failed because `jsonwebtoken` library uses Node.js `crypto` module, which is not available in Edge Runtime.

**Error Log:**
```
[Middleware] Invalid session token: Error: The edge runtime does not support Node.js 'crypto' module.
Learn More: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/node-module-in-edge-runtime
    at middleware (middleware.ts:70:21)
```

**Issue 3: Session Cookie Not Persisting Across Redirects**
After fixing Issues 1 & 2, OAuth callback was setting cookies using `cookies().set()` then immediately redirecting. In Next.js 15, cookies set via the `cookies()` API are not automatically included in redirect responses. Result: Session cookie was lost during redirect, causing authentication to fail.

**Playwright Test Result:**
```
=== Navigating to /admin/onboarding ===
← RESPONSE: 307 http://localhost:9000/admin/onboarding
→ REQUEST: GET http://localhost:9000/admin/login

=== Session Cookies ===
  admin_session: MISSING  ❌
  admin_logged_in: MISSING

❌ PROBLEM: Redirected to login page
   This means the onboarding page auth check failed
```

**Issue 4: Admin Layout Redirecting Based on localStorage**
After fixing Issues 1-3, cookies were being set correctly and middleware was allowing the onboarding page, BUT the admin layout (`/app/admin/layout.tsx`) was checking `localStorage.getItem('admin_logged_in')` which was empty after OAuth login. The layout's `useEffect` ran before the page's `useEffect`, causing an immediate redirect to login.

**Terminal Logs Showing the Problem:**
```
[Middleware] ✅ Session valid, allowing: /admin/onboarding
GET /admin/onboarding 200 in 240ms
GET /admin/login 200 in 20ms  ← Only 20ms later, no /api/admin/me call!
```

**Root Cause:**
- OAuth callback sets HTTP-only cookies ✅
- BUT doesn't set `localStorage.setItem('admin_logged_in', 'true')` ❌
- Layout checks `isAuthenticatedSync()` which reads localStorage ❌
- Returns `false` → redirects to login ❌

**Root Cause:**
1. `lib/auth.server.ts` uses `jwt.sign()` to create proper JWT tokens (Node.js runtime)
2. `app/api/auth/google/callback/route.ts` defined its own `encodeSession()` that used base64
3. `middleware.ts` runs in Edge Runtime but used `jsonwebtoken` library (requires Node.js `crypto`)
4. OAuth callback used `cookies().set()` then immediately returned a redirect
5. In Next.js 15, cookies set via `cookies()` API are not included in redirect responses unless set on the NextResponse object
6. Result: Session cookie was lost, authentication failed after redirect

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Phase 1 - JWT Token Creation:**
   - Exported `encodeSession()` function from `/lib/auth.server.ts:26`
   - Updated `/app/api/auth/google/callback/route.ts` to import and use JWT-based `encodeSession()`
   - Removed duplicate base64 encoding function

2. **Phase 2 - Edge Runtime Compatibility:**
   - Installed `jose` package (Edge Runtime compatible JWT library)
   - Updated `/middleware.ts` to use `jose` instead of `jsonwebtoken`
   - Converted middleware to async function to support `jwtVerify()`
   - Both libraries use HS256 algorithm for compatibility

3. **Phase 3 - Cookie Persistence in Redirects:**
   - Changed OAuth callback to NOT mix `cookies()` API with `response.cookies`
   - Read OAuth state from `request.cookies.get()` instead of `await cookies()`
   - Set all cookies on `NextResponse` object consistently
   - Ensures cookies are included in redirect headers

4. **Phase 4 - Admin Layout Public Pages:**
   - Added `/admin/onboarding` to public pages list in `/app/admin/layout.tsx:27`
   - This bypasses the `isAuthenticatedSync()` localStorage check
   - Lets onboarding page handle its own authentication via server-side API call
   - Also added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls in onboarding page

**Files Changed:**
- `/lib/auth.server.ts:26` - Exported `encodeSession` function (uses `jsonwebtoken` for Node.js runtime)
- `/app/api/auth/google/callback/route.ts:4` - Import `encodeSession` from auth.server (removed `cookies` import)
- `/app/api/auth/google/callback/route.ts:33` - Read OAuth state from `request.cookies.get()` instead of `await cookies()`
- `/app/api/auth/google/callback/route.ts:154-177` - Set cookies consistently on NextResponse object
- `/middleware.ts:2` - Import `jwtVerify` from `jose` instead of `jsonwebtoken`
- `/middleware.ts:11` - Added secret encoding for Edge Runtime: `new TextEncoder().encode(JWT_SECRET)`
- `/middleware.ts:39` - Made middleware async
- `/middleware.ts:36` - Added `/api/auth/google/callback` to public paths
- `/app/admin/layout.tsx:27` - **Added `/admin/onboarding` to public pages list** (KEY FIX)
- `/app/admin/onboarding/page.tsx:22` - Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch call
- `/package.json` - Added `jose` dependency

**Testing:**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install jose

# 2. Server auto-reloads with new middleware

# 3. Manual test in browser:
#    - Navigate to http://localhost:9000/admin/login
#    - Click "Sign in with Google"
#    - Complete OAuth flow
#    - EXPECTED: Stay on /admin/onboarding (NOT redirect to /admin/login)
#    - EXPECTED: See onboarding form (school name, slug)

# 4. Automated test to verify cookie behavior:
npx playwright test debug-oauth-cookies --headed
#    - Should show: admin_session: MISSING (without OAuth)
#    - After OAuth: Cookies should persist across redirect
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Bug #10: Session Not Updated After Onboarding - Users See Wrong School Events
**File:** `/app/api/admin/onboarding/route.ts`
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Fixed Date:** 2025-11-10

**Description:**
After a user completes the onboarding process and creates their school, the database was correctly updated with the new `schoolId`, but the JWT session cookie was NOT updated. This caused all subsequent API calls to use the old session (with `schoolId: undefined`), resulting in users seeing events from wrong schools or the "Default School".

**User Report:**
```
"created new: 345287info@gmail.com, why i see the default school??"
User created school "tempppp" but dashboard showed 3 events from "Default School" instead of 0 events (correct for new school).
```

**Investigation:**
1. ✅ Database correctly showed: User linked to school "tempppp" (schoolId: cmhtby6uq0008mt01718tlxup)
2. ✅ Events API correctly filters by schoolId from JWT session
3. ❌ **JWT session cookie still had `schoolId: undefined` from initial OAuth login**
4. ❌ Result: API filtering failed, showed events from all schools or wrong school

**Root Cause:**
The onboarding API route updated the database with `schoolId` but did not create and set a new JWT session cookie with the updated school information. The old session cookie persisted across requests, causing data isolation to break.

**Code Before Fix:**
```typescript
// app/api/admin/onboarding/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ... validation ...

  const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    const school = await tx.school.create({...})
    const admin = await tx.admin.update({
      where: { id: currentAdmin.adminId },
      data: {
        schoolId: school.id,  // ✅ Database updated
        onboardingCompleted: true,
      },
    })
    return { school, admin }
  })

  // ❌ Session cookie NOT updated - still has old schoolId!

  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    school: {...},
    admin: {...},
  })
}
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// app/api/admin/onboarding/route.ts
import { getCurrentAdmin, encodeSession, SESSION_COOKIE_NAME, AuthSession } from '@/lib/auth.server'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ... validation and database update ...

  const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    const school = await tx.school.create({...})
    const admin = await tx.admin.update({
      where: { id: currentAdmin.adminId },
      data: {
        schoolId: school.id,
        onboardingCompleted: true,
      },
      include: { school: true },
    })
    return { school, admin }
  })

  // ✅ Create updated session with new school information
  const updatedSession: AuthSession = {
    adminId: result.admin.id,
    email: result.admin.email,
    name: result.admin.name,
    role: result.admin.role,
    schoolId: result.school.id,      // NEW: Include school ID
    schoolName: result.school.name,   // NEW: Include school name
  }

  const response = NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'הארגון נוצר בהצלחה!',
    school: {...},
    admin: {...},
  })

  // ✅ Update session cookie with new school information
  response.cookies.set(SESSION_COOKIE_NAME, encodeSession(updatedSession), {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    sameSite: 'lax',
    maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 7 days
    path: '/',
  })

  return response
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `/app/api/admin/onboarding/route.ts:3` - Added imports: `encodeSession`, `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`, `AuthSession`
- `/app/api/admin/onboarding/route.ts:92` - Added `include: { school: true }` to admin update query
- `/app/api/admin/onboarding/route.ts:101-108` - Created `updatedSession` object with new school information
- `/app/api/admin/onboarding/route.ts:127-133` - Set session cookie with updated JWT before returning response

**Impact:**
- Multi-tenant data isolation now works correctly immediately after onboarding
- Users see only their own school's events without needing to logout/login
- Session state matches database state throughout the onboarding flow

**Testing:**
```bash
# 1. Build succeeds
npm run build

# 2. Manual test on production:
#    - Create new account via OAuth
#    - Complete onboarding with unique school name
#    - Dashboard should show 0 events (not Default School events)
#    - Create new event
#    - Event should appear in dashboard (correct school filtering)
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
