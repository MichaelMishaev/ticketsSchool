## 🏆 Best Practices

### 1. **Always Start with Blue** 🔵
Before writing code, search first. Blue agents are 96% cheaper.

```bash
# Good workflow
🔵 "Use blue-registration-finder to find capacity code"
🟢 "Use green-bug-fixer to fix the issue"

# Bad workflow
🔴 "Use red-architect to find and fix capacity bug" ← Wasted $4!
```

### 2. **Use Green for All Code** 🟢
Green agents create production-ready code with:
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Authentication
- Error handling
- Mobile optimization
- Hebrew RTL

### 3. **Red Means STOP** 🔴
Before using Red, ask:
- Is this a critical decision affecting thousands of users?
- Can Blue or Green handle this?
- Is it worth 25x the cost?

If not all YES, use Blue or Green instead.

### 4. **Run Blue Agents in Parallel** 🔵🔵🔵
Blue agents are cheap and fast. Run multiple simultaneously!

```bash
# Good - parallel execution
"Use blue-schema-explorer, blue-security-scanner, and blue-registration-finder in parallel"

# Less efficient - sequential
"Use blue-schema-explorer" → wait → "Use blue-security-scanner" → wait...
```

### 5. **Document Everything**
Green agents automatically document:
- Bug fixes → `/docs/bugs/bugs.md`
- API changes → Code comments
- Test coverage → Test files

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Agents (Done!)
All agents are in `.claude/agents/` directory.

### Step 2: View Available Agents
```bash
/agents
```

### Step 3: Use Agents
Just mention them in your requests:
```bash
"Use blue-security-scanner to check for XSS"
"Use green-api-builder to create export endpoint"
```

Claude will automatically invoke the right agent!

### Step 4: Monitor Costs
Track your usage:
- 🔵 Blue: $0.20 each (use freely!)
- 🟢 Green: $1 each (use often)
- 🔴 Red: $5 each (use rarely!)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Good Usage Pattern (Optimized)
```
Daily agent usage:
🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵 (6 Blue searches) = $1.20
🟢🟢🟢 (3 Green code changes) = $3
🔴 (0 Red analyses) = $0
Total: $4.20/day

Monthly: ~$84
```

### Bad Usage Pattern (Expensive)
```
Daily agent usage:
🔴🔴🔴 (3 Red analyses) = $15
🟢 (1 Green) = $1
Total: $16/day

Monthly: ~$320
```

**Savings with optimized pattern: $236/month (74% reduction!)**

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Which agent should I use?"
Use the decision tree above or ask:
1. Finding something? → 🔵 Blue
2. Writing code? → 🟢 Green
3. Critical decision? → 🔴 Red (rarely!)

### "Can I use multiple agents?"
Yes! Blue agents especially benefit from parallel execution.

### "Agent not working?"
1. Check agent exists: `/agents`
2. Check syntax: "Use [agent-name] to [task]"
3. Check if agent has the right tools for the task

### "Too expensive?"
- Reduce Red usage (should be <5% of tasks)
- Increase Blue usage (should be ~60% of tasks)
- Run Blue agents in parallel (faster + cheaper)
