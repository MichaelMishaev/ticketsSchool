## 🎯 The 3-Second Decision

```
Need to FIND something? ────➤ 🔵 BLUE ($0.20)
Need to WRITE code? ────────➤ 🟢 GREEN ($1)
Need DEEP analysis? ────────➤ 🔴 RED ($5) - RARE!
```

---

## 🔵 Blue Agents (Use Often!)

| Agent | Use For | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **blue-schema-explorer** | DB models & relations | "Find Event model fields" |
| **blue-security-scanner** | Security vulnerabilities | "Check for data leaks" |
| **blue-registration-finder** | Registration logic | "Find capacity enforcement" |

**Cost:** $0.20 each | **Speed:** 5-15 seconds | **Use:** 60% of tasks

---

## 🟢 Green Agents (Use Daily!)

| Agent | Use For | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **green-api-builder** | API endpoints | "Create event export API" |
| **green-form-builder** | React forms (RTL) | "Build registration form" |
| **green-bug-fixer** | Fix bugs + document | "Fix session cookie bug" |
| **green-test-writer** | Playwright tests | "Test registration flow" |

**Cost:** $1 each | **Speed:** 20-60 seconds | **Use:** 35% of tasks

---

## 🔴 Red Agent (Use Rarely!)

| Agent | Use For | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **red-architect** | Critical decisions | "Security audit for launch" |

**Cost:** $5 each (25x Blue!) | **Speed:** 2-5 minutes | **Use:** 5% of tasks

⚠️ **Before using Red, ask:** Can Blue or Green handle this?

## 💡 Common Workflows

### 1. Search & Modify
```
🔵 "Use blue-schema-explorer to find User model"
🟢 "Use green-api-builder to add user export"
Cost: $1.20 | Time: 35 seconds
```

### 2. Bug Fix
```
🔵 "Use blue-registration-finder for capacity code"
🟢 "Use green-bug-fixer to fix race condition"
🟢 "Use green-test-writer to add test"
Cost: $2.20 | Time: 100 seconds
```

### 3. New Feature
```
🔵 "Use blue-schema-explorer for Event model"
🟢 "Use green-form-builder for event form"
🟢 "Use green-api-builder for event API"
🟢 "Use green-test-writer for E2E tests"
Cost: $3.20 | Time: 2 minutes
```

### 4. Pre-Launch Audit (Rare!)
```
🔴 "Use red-architect for security audit"
Cost: $5 | Time: 3 minutes
```

## 📊 Cost Comparison

| Your Day | Old Cost | New Cost | Savings |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 6 searches | $30 | 🔵 $1.20 | 96% |
| 3 code changes | $15 | 🟢 $3 | 80% |
| 1 deep analysis | $5 | 🔴 $5 | 0% |
| **Total** | **$50** | **$9.20** | **82%** |

---

## 🏆 Golden Rules

1. **Blue first** - Search before you code
2. **Green for code** - Let agents write production code
3. **Red rarely** - Only for critical decisions
4. **Parallel Blues** - Run 🔵🔵🔵 together (fast!)
5. **Document everything** - Agents auto-document

---

## 🚦 Usage Pattern (Optimal)

```
Your week should look like:
🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵 (30 Blue)
🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢 (18 Green)
🔴 (1 Red)

Cost: $6 + $18 + $5 = $29/week
```

```
NOT like this:
🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴 (7 Red)
Cost: $35/week (just on Red!)
```

## ⚡ Speed Reference

| Agent | Speed | When |
|-------|-------|------|
| 🔵 Blue | 5-15s | Quick searches |
| 🟢 Green | 20-60s | Code generation |
| 🔴 Red | 120-300s | Deep analysis |

---

## 🎯 Cheat Sheet: "I need to..."

| I need to... | Agent | Command |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| Find a model | 🔵 blue-schema-explorer | "Find Event model" |
| Check security | 🔵 blue-security-scanner | "Scan for XSS" |
| Find registration | 🔵 blue-registration-finder | "Where's waitlist logic?" |
| Create API | 🟢 green-api-builder | "Build export endpoint" |
| Make a form | 🟢 green-form-builder | "Create login form" |
| Fix a bug | 🟢 green-bug-fixer | "Fix session issue" |
| Write tests | 🟢 green-test-writer | "Test registration" |
| Major decision | 🔴 red-architect | "Should we microservice?" |

---

## 🔥 Pro Tips

### Tip #1: Parallel Blues
```bash
# Instead of sequential:
"Use blue-schema-explorer" → wait
"Use blue-security-scanner" → wait

# Do parallel:
"Use blue-schema-explorer, blue-security-scanner, and blue-registration-finder in parallel"
# 3x faster! 🚀
```

### Tip #2: Green for Quality
Green agents include:
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation
- ✅ Authentication
- ✅ Mobile optimization
- ✅ Hebrew RTL
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Tests

### Tip #3: Avoid Red
Challenge: Go 1 week without Red agent.
(You can do 95% of tasks with Blue + Green!)

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Which agent?" | Use decision tree: Find?🔵 Code?🟢 Critical?🔴 |
| "Too slow" | Use Blue agents in parallel 🔵🔵🔵 |
| "Too expensive" | Reduce Red usage to <5% of tasks |
| "Agent failed" | Check `/agents` to verify it exists |

---

## 📱 Keep This Handy!

**Save this file or print it.**

When in doubt:
1. Check this reference card
2. Start with Blue 🔵
3. Move to Green 🟢 when ready
4. Avoid Red 🔴 unless critical

---

**Remember: Blue = Find, Green = Build, Red = Think (rarely!)**
